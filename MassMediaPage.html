                    Cases such as sushant singh rajput’s death to which 
                    the entire nation is emotionally connected gives a perfect opportunity for the media to push their opinions on the 
                    general public’s consensus.	The sad part of these situations is that any democratic government has to spend enormous 
                    resources to verify the allegations from the general public because of trial by media. Twists and turns occurred in 
                    the case because of media swaying the general public from the truth were
                       
                    <div class="table-info>">

                        <ul>
                            <li>Death vs suicide </li>
                            <li> Bollywood vs Outsider</li>
                            <li>Arab mafia money laundering </li>
                            <li> Maharashtra government vs Bihar government</li>
                            <li> CBI vs NCB </li>
                            <li>Kangana vs Maharashtra government </li>
                    </ul>

                    </div>
                    

                    The case had long back taken turn from the fact that some body was murdered in cold blood to business, political, and 
                    personal benefits of media houses, political parties, and individuals. <br>

                    There are multiple cases as such. I have listed a few for your reference.

                    <h3>Political Agenda </h3>
                    Almost every other mass media company is directly owned or associated with some politician in India which makes it
                    impossible for the general public to get unbiased information regarding the ongoing events. Political parties use
                    these media houses to label something as false news that might not have good reflection on the party. It is a 
                    major political strategy for dampening the value of that information. If the regional situation is considered in 
                    andhra pradesh two big media houses are directly associated with the ruling and opposition parties. This situation 
                    almost always leads to trial by media in any important case against either the ruling or opposition party leading 
                    to persuading the general public to side with the political party’s agenda even before the trial happens in the court.<br>

                    <h3>Political Propaganda</h3>

                        In a country such as China and North korea where the mass media companies are directly owned by the governments 
                        there is no meaning for freedom of press.These media companies are widely used to further the propaganda of 
                        ruling governments and keep its citizens under control feeding them information which the government sees as 
                        necessary. Global Times, an official media house of China's ruling party supports all of the deliberate misleading 
                        actions done by chinese military at India- China border as part of it’s peace making. It has also posted an article 
                        saying 72% of China's citizens agree to go to war with India propagating the it’s government’s opinion to sway 
                        general public consensus.<br>
