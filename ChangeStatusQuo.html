                    <h2>How can we come out of the status quo and protect ourselves from misinformation</h2>
                    Well, the first step to change the status quo is to realise that you are also a part of it and to learn how in the
                    first place have you become part of spreading misinformation. <br>
                    To get a fair idea of the above questions go through the following quick videos

                    <h2>These are my final thoughts on how to protect people from misinformation </h2>

                    <p>
                        
                        <h3>Self Introspection</h3>
                        First thing we need to do is Accept that we donâ€™t know enough about these media platforms as to how they are 
                        designed and how they can be used to spread false information. Accepting is the first step to avoid falling 
                        prey to misinformation. Remind yourself that the opinion of the majority of people doesn't make it a fact. 
                        Whenever we come across some new information which is not exactly in the lines of general consensus, just take 
                        a pause and verify the reliability of that information before you share it. Before we consider some information 
                        as factual we should corroborate it with multiple sources and critically evaluate it.

                    </p>

                        <h3>Democratization of data</h3>

                        Whenever we humans come across some new information we start thinking about how to process that information and 
                        whether to share it or not. Labeling information to signal quality and accuracy much the same way how we label 
                        the food items in terms of its calorie content, origin, and how it is produced would give a much clearer picture 
                        for the general public before they consume and share the information and help make smart decisions using the 
                        information. However by no means labeling will solve the whole issue at hand as labeling should be done by an 
                        individual or an organisation but it will definitely help mitigate the issue.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h3>Dis-incentivising the false information</h3>

                        As false news or opinions travel more farther, faster, and deeper and reach more eyes than factual information, 
                        people get paid a lot more to advertise false content. So if we can somehow create a procedure to dis-incentivise 
                        people for creating false content, for instance we can demote or block their accounts for a certain period of time.
                        As discussed above if we can achieve democratization of data it would be much easier to apply procedures to 
                        dis-incentivise people for creating false news.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h3>Developing algorithms to segregate misinformation from factual information in social media</h3>

                        Now that we already have an incredible amount of data on how people consume and share information as billions 
                        of people interact and share information every minute, we can build advanced algorithms using machine and deep 
                        learning techniques to know more about human behaviour and psychology and come up with models to dampen the 
                        spread of false news and provide clarity to public on what they are consuming.
